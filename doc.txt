INTERSECTION TYPES
they allow us to combine 2 different types
ex: 
type t1 = {
    name: string
}
type t2 = {
    age: number
}
type mixTs = t1 & t2 
const tmp: mixTs // here we are declaring a variable in ts way
tmp = {
    name: 'justin'  // now here when we are assigned a value to tmp
    age: 25         // we should follow the t1 and t2 types
}
this is especially useful  with obj types but can be with others as well
ex: type Combine = string
type Numberic = number | boolean

type Universal = Combine & Numberic
